"""
A ROS2 script to command a ROSBot 2 to navigate a pre-defined serpentine path
through a simulated macadamia orchard.

This script uses the Nav2 Simple Commander API to send a sequence of goals.

Prerequisites:
1. A fully functional Nav2 stack is running.
2. A map of the environment (with the 'trees' as obstacles) has been created and is
   loaded by the map_server.
3. AMCL or another localization system is running and the robot is well-localized.
